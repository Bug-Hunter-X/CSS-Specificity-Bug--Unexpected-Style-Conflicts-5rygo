To solve the specificity issue, you can adjust selectors or use the `!important` flag (though it's generally discouraged due to maintainability issues).  Here are a few approaches:

**1. Increase Specificity of the Intended Selector:**

```css
div.highlight p { color: red; /* More specific: targets div with highlight class */ }
```

**2. Use the `!important` Flag (Use with Caution):**

```css
div p { color: blue; }
.highlight p { color: red !important; /* Overrides other rules */ }
```

**3. Refactor CSS for Clarity (Recommended):**

If possible, reorganize your CSS to avoid conflicts and make it easier to understand. This is often the best solution.

```css
/* Style your base paragraph */
p { color: blue; }

/* Style specific highlight paragraphs */
.highlight p { color: red; }

/* Or, use a more specific class if needed */
.highlight-paragraph { color: red; }
```
Choosing the appropriate solution will vary depending on your specific needs and project context.  Prioritize code readability and maintainability whenever possible.
